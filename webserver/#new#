I want to become a TA to help students overcome their difficulties, learn how to code, and eventually, fall in love with programming. As a student, I have had a lot of challenges in learning, especially in computer science. I moved to America 5 years ago without knowing any English. By the time I transferred to Berkeley, I didn’t have a lot of background on programming and started almost from scratch. However, I really enjoyed learning about programming and how the machines work. Last semester, I took CS61B with professor Hilfinger and I really enjoyed the class. I specifically liked how he encouraged students to be more independent by making them read the manual and do reading to work on homework and project. Right now, taking CS162, I realize just how important that skill is. I really enjoyed solving tricky programming problems as well as designing elegant and efficient algorithms. 

I have always enjoyed teaching. In my community college, I volunteered to tutor. I am also a lab assistant in CS61B this semester. My tutoring experience helped me sympathize with students’ struggles and be aware of their difficulties. I learned to never give students the answer but give hints and help them find their own mistakes so they can improve in the future. And most importantly, I learned to be humble and patient because I probably made the same mistake before.    

I hope that I can have a chance to teach students, to help them learn and enjoy a great summer.
